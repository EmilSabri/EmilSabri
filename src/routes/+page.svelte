    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
        Hey, I’m Emil and this is my site for all things me.
        I’m a computer science grad from UC, Irvine with about 2 years of work experience.
        Recently started taking my entrepreneurship dreams seriously.
        Instead of delaying the inevitable,I’ve decided to go all in.
    </p>
    <p>
        The main impetus for creating this site is to improve my frontend skills before working
        on my company site SabriSaaS.com, which I’ll need polished before applying to some
        social platform’s business APIs.
    </p>
    <p>
        Look around and you’ll find blog posts, status updates, and projects that I’m currently 
        working on to further progress my goal.
    </p>

    <h1>Plan</h1>
    <p>
        My plan of attack is fairly simple.
        Create a shit ton of Shopify apps then build up to standalone SaaS products.
